NG02801: Angular detected that `HttpClient` is not configured to use `fetch` APIs. It's strongly recommended to enable `fetch` for applications that use Server-Side Rendering for better performance and compatibility. To enable `fetch`, add the `withFetch()` to the `provideHttpClient()` call at the root of the application.   
(node:17200) [DEP0169] DeprecationWarning: `url.parse()` behavior is not standardized and prone to errors that have security implications. Use the WHATWG URL API instead. CVEs are not issued for `url.parse()` vulnerabilities.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
